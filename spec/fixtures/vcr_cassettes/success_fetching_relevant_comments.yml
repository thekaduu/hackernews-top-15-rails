        a few qualms with this app:<p>1. For a Linux user, you can already build such
        a system yourself quite trivially by getting an FTP account, mounting it locally
        with curlftpfs, and then using SVN or CVS on the mounted filesystem.  From
        Windows or Mac, this FTP account could be accessed through built-in software.<p>2.
        It doesn''t actually replace a USB drive.  Most people I know e-mail files
        to themselves or host them somewhere online to be able to perform presentations,
        but they still carry a USB drive in case there are connectivity problems.  This
        does not solve the connectivity issue.<p>3. It does not seem very \"viral\"
        or income-generating.  I know this is premature at this point, but without
        charging users for the service, is it reasonable to expect to make money off
        of this?","time":1175786214,"type":"comment"}'

        I know you lost me very early into it switching between windows.<p>If you
        are looking for a wider audience than those who already know the context of
        dropbox, make a video where you lay out the case for use of dropbox using
        simple examples from user point of view(think a college student) and then
        in the demo show just the basic features. I got the feeling you tried to show
        too many features too quickly.<p>In general, I have realized it is much better
        to launch with something that does a few things REALLY well rather than a
        lot of things with little focus. When you launch with whole lot of features
        people assume you are competing with the big companies. When you launch small
        and do it well, it is easier to attract a user-base and THEN keep feeding
        it more advance features in form of updates.<p>Good luck! Looks slick from
        the UI.\n","time":1175715380,"type":"comment"}'
