        another example of 1) the vocal minority does not necessarily reflect the

        in exchange for taking a stance on an issue.<p>It&#x27;s much the same as
        people frequently complaining about Hollywood remaking the same movies over
        and over again while at the same time remakes continue to rake in money for
        studios.  Businesses will follow the money, angry hardliners be damned.","time":1579035539,"type":"comment"}'
